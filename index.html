      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a social butterfly though a closet nerd.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm 100% Filipino but born and raised in the U.S.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Hanging out with friends, video games, basketball, golf, volleyball, binging Netflix/YouTube, drinking, in that order.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One that feels more like fun instead of just an obligation and where I can support my family and travel.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Chicago, IL</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In all honesty, I love nerding out. I've always been intrigued by the 1s and 0s and coding language since Xanga was a thing, if anyone remembers that. While I've never had much experience aside from minimal self learning for how to change the layout of the webpage, the curiousity to learn it more in depth has never left.</p>
